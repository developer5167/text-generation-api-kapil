1.What is a chit fund.
A)The customer can save the money; it is not an investment.


2)How does chit fund work.
A)A chit fund with Kapil Chits works like a rotating savings and credit group where members contribute a fixed amount each month. Each month, an auction is held where the subscriber who bids the highest discount wins the prize money for that month. The remaining money is then divided equally among all members as a dividend after deducting the company's commission. 
How it works
Join a group: You join a group with a predetermined duration and monthly contribution, based on the chit plan that fits your financial needs.
Monthly contributions: Every member contributes the same fixed amount each month to a central pot. The total number of months is equal to the number of subscribers in the group.
Monthly auction: Each month, an auction takes place where subscribers bid for the prize money.
The subscriber who bids the highest discount is the winner for that month.
The winner receives the prize money, which is the total pot value minus the discount they bid.
Dividend distribution: The remaining amount (the total discount) is distributed equally among all subscribers as a "chit dividend" after the company's commission is deducted.
Repetition: This process repeats each month until all members have had a turn to receive the prize money. Even after receiving the prize, you continue to make your monthly payments until the cycle is complete.

Chit funds work as both a savings plan and a borrowing option. They let members get a lump sum of money quickly for needs like education, business, or emergencies—without needing collateral or heavy paperwork. They also help people save regularly, and those who wait longer to take the money can sometimes earn better returns than fixed deposits.

4.Is chit fund safe to invest?
Chit funds are safe only when they are registered and regulated under the Chit Funds Act, 1982. Unregistered chit funds are risky and can lead to fraud, so always check if the fund is legally registered and trustworthy before investing. Registered chit funds offer better protection, clarity, and security, while unregistered ones offer no legal help if problems arise.
