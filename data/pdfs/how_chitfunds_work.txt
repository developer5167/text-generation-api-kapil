CHITFUND_BASICS:

BASIC_CONCEPT:
- Definition: Group savings scheme with monthly contributions
- Participants: Group of subscribers (typically 20-50 members)
- Duration: Equal to number of members (e.g., 20 members = 20 months)
- Monthly Collection: Total of all members' contributions

KEY_TERMINOLOGY:
- Subscriber: Member who joins the chit fund scheme
- Chit Value: Total monthly collection from all subscribers
- Prized Subscriber: Member who wins the auction in a month
- Non-Prized Subscriber: Members who haven't won auction yet
- Foreman: Chit fund company managing the scheme
- Dividend: Share of discount distributed to all subscribers

MONTHLY_PROCESS:

STEP_1_CONTRIBUTIONS:
- Each subscriber pays monthly installment
- Total collection forms the "chit fund value" or "pot"
- Example: 20 members × ₹5,000 each = ₹1,00,000 monthly pot

STEP_2_AUCTION:
- Monthly auction conducted by foreman
- Subscribers bid for maximum discount on chit value
- Highest bidder (offering maximum discount) wins prize money

STEP_3_PRIZE_DISTRIBUTION:
- Winner receives discount-adjusted prize money
- Example: 30% discount on ₹1,00,000 = ₹70,000 to winner
- 5% foreman commission deducted from discount

STEP_4_DIVIDEND_DISTRIBUTION:
- Remaining discount distributed as dividend to all subscribers
- Example: ₹25,000 remaining ÷ 20 members = ₹1,250 each

STEP_5_NEXT_MONTH:
- Process repeats monthly until scheme completion
- Each member gets one opportunity to win auction

DETAILED_EXAMPLE:

EXAMPLE_SCENARIO:
- Scheme: 20 members, ₹5,000 monthly, 20 months duration
- Monthly Pot: ₹1,00,000 (20 × ₹5,000)
- Auction: Ram bids 30% discount (highest bid)
- Prize Money: ₹1,00,000 - 30% = ₹70,000 to Ram
- Foreman Commission: 5% of ₹1,00,000 = ₹5,000
- Dividend Pool: ₹30,000 - ₹5,000 = ₹25,000
- Each Member Dividend: ₹25,000 ÷ 20 = ₹1,250
- Next Month Installment: ₹5,000 - ₹1,250 = ₹3,750
