2.What is the auction process?
Collection of Contributions

All subscribers contribute a fixed amount to the chit fund at the start of the month.

This pooled amount is the prize money for that cycle.

Bidding for the Chit Amount

Subscribers who need the money can bid to take the fund.

Each bidder offers a discount, which is the amount they are willing to forego from the total fund.

Winning the Auction

The subscriber offering the highest discount wins the auction for that month.

They receive the remaining fund after deducting the discount.

Distribution of the Discount

The discount amount is distributed equally among all subscribers (except the winner).

This reduces the effective contribution for everyone.

Next Cycle

The process repeats every month until all members have received the chit amount once


3.When are auctions conducted?
Scheduled Auction Date:

Each chit fund has a predefined schedule (usually monthly) for auctions.

The app notifies all subscribers when the auction is about to start.

Digital Bidding:

Subscribers place their bids through the app.

The bid typically indicates the discount or foregone amount they are willing to take from the total chit sum.

Auction Timing:

The auction is conducted at a fixed time within the app on the scheduled date.

Some apps allow a time window for all subscribers to place their bids.

Winner Announcement:

The subscriber who offers the highest discount is selected automatically by the app.

The app then distributes the remaining chit amount to the winner and updates the account balances of all members.



4.How to bid in auction?
A).A subscriber can participate in the auction by selecting an amount and clicking “Enter Bid Amount.” Each bid is recorded in the bid history. The auction continues until it reaches completion.

5.What is the minimum bid amount?
A).The minimum bid amount would then be the chit amount minus the maximum discount allowed.
Example:
Chit value: ₹100,000
Maximum discount allowed: 10% (₹10,000)
Minimum bid = ₹100,000 – ₹10,000 = ₹90,000


6.Explain auction step by step
A).1. Participation in the Auction

   Only subscribers without any due amount can participate in the auction.
   If a subscriber has pending dues, they must clear their outstanding amount before being allowed to bid.

   2. Starting the Auction
   The auction is initiated by the auctioneer.
   Once started, eligible subscribers can place their bids.

   3. Placing a Bid
   Subscribers select the bid amount and click the “Enter” button.
   The bid amount is then recorded in the bid history.
   Bidding continues in intervals of 5 or 10 minutes, as per the auction rules.

   4. How Bidding Works
   The bid typically represents a discount on the total chit amount.
   Example: If the chit amount is ₹100,000 and a subscriber bids ₹10,000, they will receive ₹90,000 (₹100,000 – ₹10,000).
   The discount amount is distributed among all members as a dividend.

   5. Minimum Bid Amount
   There is a minimum bid amount to ensure fair participation.
   This is generally 1% of the chit amount or as specified in the chit agreement.
   Example: For a ₹100,000 chit, the minimum bid could be ₹1,000.

   6. Final Bidding Rules
   If no subscriber places a maximum bid, the final bidder gets the chit amount.
   If all subscribers place maximum bids, the chit is awarded through a lucky draw (spin).
   The subscriber whose ticket number the spin stops on wins the chit for that month.


7.What is the bidding process?
A)1. Participation Eligibility
      When the auction starts, all subscribers are shown a "Participate" button.
      Only subscribers who have cleared all their due amounts are allowed to join the auction.
      Subscribers with pending dues will see a "Please clear due amount" message and cannot participate until their dues are cleared.
        
 2. Starting the Auction
     Any eligible subscriber can start the auction.
     Once the auction is started, all eligible subscribers can click the "Participate" button to enter the bidding.
     After participation, the auction page is displayed for the subscriber to begin bidding.


 3. Bidding Process
     Subscribers can either select a bid amount or manually enter an amount.
     After entering the amount, they click the "Enter" button, and the amount is added to the bid history for transparency.
     Example Calculation:
     Chit value = ₹100,000
      Foreman commission = 5%
     Maximum discount allowed = 25%
     Minimum bid amount allowed = ₹5,000
     Maximum bid amount allowed = ₹25,000
     Subscribers continue to bid according to the timeline set for that auction.
      The subscriber who offers the highest acceptable bid (lowest discounted amount) wins the chit for the month.

  4. Special Case: All Maximum Bids
      If all participating subscribers place the maximum allowable bid, the auction does not conclude in the usual way.
      In this case, the system automatically redirects to a spin functionality:
      The auctioneer starts the spin.
       When the spin stops, the ticket number selected is awarded the chit for that month.

   This process ensures:
     Only eligible subscribers participate.
     Bidding is transparent and fair.
     The chit is awarded either via bidding or, in the case of a tie at maximum bid, through a random spin.


8.How are auction dates decided?
A)Auction schedule mentioned in the chit agreement.


9.What happens during auction?
A)Collection of Bids:
   All members of the chit (who have subscribed for the month) submit their bids. The bid is essentially the discount they are willing to take on the chit amount.
   For example, if the chit value is ₹1,00,000, a member might bid ₹5,000, meaning they are willing to take ₹95,000 now and forego ₹5,000, which will be distributed among other members.

Determining the Highest Bid (Lowest Amount Received):
  The member who bids the highest discount (or lowest amount to be received) wins the auction.
  The discounted amount is called the auction amount or foreman’s cut, which will be shared among the other members as a dividend.

Distribution of Dividend:
   The discount amount (e.g., ₹5,000 in the example) is divided equally among all members of the chit except the winner.
   This reduces the effective contribution of the other members for that month.

Payment to Winner:
   The winner gets the chit money minus the bid amount immediately.
   After the auction, normal contributions continue every month until all members have received the chit money once.

Continuation of Chit Cycle:
The process repeats every month with a new auction until all members get their share.
